# Instagram Clone
## Any Questions email me at [rails_dev@codengine.org](mailto:rails_dev@codengine.org)
## Description
### This is a clone of Instagram using Swift 5 and iOS 15. The best way to start this project would be to clone the repo and open it in xcode. Throughout the project we will create branches to checkout to show specific things to do and how to build this app using this README without encountering any issues.
### I have always had trouble with using a README or documentation to code an app and it discouraged me to do so for a while due to many personal problems that encouraged me to take an "easier" route but led to my downfall. Due to this I will make it my best try to be able to produce a README with no issues and allow developers to easily learn how to build apps, understand what is behind it, and give people enough confidence to work hard and get a job. 
## Section 1 (How to use Xcode properly)
### Now I remember Xcode was much easier to use before the changes but I realized the UI additions can simply be done by clicking the + button on the top right and it should give you access to the UI components.
### Start off by creating a regular app using storyboard and not SWIFTUI. Until SwiftUI is used in more projects I would encourage learning how to use Storyboard first as it is used more for jobs and UIkit.
## Section 2 (Build the iOS app architecture)
### Create 5 folders of Products, Resources, Models, Views, Controllers, and Core tabs. You can create folders by simply right clicking the Folder IGClone and clicking New File. REMEMBER there is an IGClone folder and an IGClone directory. Directory meaning the original source where app begins and if you see in Xcode it has an app store icon to the left of it.
### I would refer to iOS app architecture branch to see the overall architecture and how to begin this project. NOTE to create the swift files simply right click on the folder and click new file (Now we want to use Cocoa Touch Class as the type of file we will create). Once we click the type of file and next we change the ViewController placeholder to the specific ones shown in `ios-app-architecture` branch.
### Please proceed to do so for all of the folders as shown.
